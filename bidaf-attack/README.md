# Attack BiDAF Model

This repo contains the code to attack BiDAF.

## Prepare BiDAF

The BiDAF is trained by ourselves. 

We put related code in root directory.  

You can reproduce the results by using the model parameters uploaded here: `model.bin` and `ema`. 


## Attack 

You may read our `run.py` for more information. You may also try try different attack scenarios (position targeted attack/answer targeted attack) and different attack methods (word-level/sentence-level)  to see the effects.
